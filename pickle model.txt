1) pickle method
2) joblib method

let's say your trained machine learning model is "model" then

the codes for saving "model" into a file using pickle method is:

# code for  pickle method

"
import pickle

# creating/writing binary file 

with open("pickle_model","wb") as f:
      pickle.dump(model,f)

# reading binary file

with open("pickle_mode","rb") as f:
     pm=pickle.load(f)
pm.predict("enter independent variables")

"

similarly the code for saving "model" into a file using joblib method is:

# the code for joblib method..

"
from sklearn.externals import joblib
joblib.dump(model,"joblib_model")
jm=joblib.load("joblib_model")
jm.predict(" enter the independent variables")

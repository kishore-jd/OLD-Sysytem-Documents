        Angular Routing

- Web Development we have to implement lot of techniques like

	a) Model Binding

	b) Caching

	c) Routing

	d) Redirection

- Routing is a technique used in web applications.

- Routing is used to configure and create more SEO friendly and User Friendly URL or URI

- SEO friendly URL allows the search engines or WebCrawlers to identify exactly what you are watching.

- User Friendly URL allows to query any content directly from URL, also to continue from where you have left.

- In SPA and Progressive Web Applications You can stay on one page and get access to everything on to the page by using routing.

- Without reloading the complete page the new details

  are added into the current page.

- Page more modular.

- Only the part that is required will be loaded

- It implement Ajax

- Angular is using routing Client Side.

- Routing in angular is a technqiue which is not completely stable.

- Modules required for handling routes in Angular

	a) Routes
	b) RouterModule

- The library for routing is defined in "@angular/router"

- "Routes" is used to configure the routes for angular application.

- "RouterModule" is used handle the routes like loding routes into route table and verifying the route references.

- Routes are configured in a special file [Reserved file]
	      "app-routing.module.ts"
		[app folder]

- Routes are created by using "Routes" module in "app-routing.module.ts"
 
            const   routes : Routes = [
                  {
                     path:
	   component:
	   redirectTo:
	   outlet:
	   pathMatch:
	   children:
                  },
                  {
                  }
             ]

FAQ: Why routes are configured with "const"?
A.  Every route must be initialized because it is defined in configuration phase. 
      In configuration there can't be declaration and rendering, there must be only initialization.
      Routes once configured can't be shadowed i.e can't be redefined.

  Route Property		Description
 ==========================================
  path	           It specifies the route name which is

Router Module
============
  It provides a set of properties and methods that are used to export and load the routes into route table. It implements "ngModule" base.

Syntax:
    @ngModule({
         imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
         exports: [RouterModule]
     })


Route Directives:
1. routerLink     : It is used to create a hyperlink that
	           navigates to specified route by using
	           the route path.

   Syntax:
     <a routerLink="path"> Text </a>

2. <router-outlet> :  It specifies the location where
	                the link target should be render.

Why learn Machine Learning with Python?

Data Science is a set of techniques that enable the computers to learn 
the desired behavior from data without explicitly being programmed. 
It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the broad areas of mathematics,
statistics, information science, and computer science. This course exposes you to different 
classes of machine learning algorithms like supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement algorithms.
This course imparts you the necessary skills like data pre-processing, dimensional reduction,
model evaluation and also exposes you to different machine learning algorithms like regression,
clustering, decision trees, random forest, Naive Bayes and Q-Learning.
